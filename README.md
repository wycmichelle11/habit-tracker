# habit-tracker
Created a habit tracker for new year resolutions.

Enter the habit you want to track, and the frequency (i.e. Read a chapter twice a week).

Then when you add the habit, you can click on it every time you complete the habit once.

The image here has completed the task once already.

If you refresh the page, the habit should still be there!

When the task is finished for the timeframe (i.e. finished Reading for the week, you can click it once more and it will be crossed-off).

If you want to reuse the same habit for the next week, simply click on it again. OR you can delete it when you don't want it in your habits list anymore.
